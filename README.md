Introduce yourself and your project goals at the very beginning of your notebook walkthrough.

Summarize your findings at the beginning like you would for an Executive Summary. Just because you don't have a slide deck for this presentation, doesn't mean you throw out everything you learned from Storytelling.

Walk us through the analysis you did to answer our questions and that lead to your findings. Relationships should be visualized and takeaways documented. Please clearly call out the questions and answers you are analyzing as well as offer insights and recommendations based on your findings.

For example: If you find that month-to-month customers churn more, we won't be surprised, but Telco is not getting rid of that plan. The fact that customers churn is not because they can; it's because they can and they are motivated to do so. We want your insights into why they are motivated to do so. We realize you will not be able to do a full causal experiment, but we would like to see some solid evidence of your conclusions.

Finish with key takeaways, recommendations, and next steps and be prepared to answer questions from the data science team about your project.

Remember you have a time limit of 5 minutes for your presentation. Make sure you practice your notebook walkthrough keeping this time limit in mind; it will go by very quickly.
